# SaveTheBlock

An evidence based Initial Coin Offering insurance to make crowdsale more protectable against hacking.

## Overview

### What problem are you tackling?

- The recent crowdsale started raising unreasonable amount of money with little transparency of technical governance.
- With more cryptocurrencies sent to and kept on smart contracts, the incident of theft and scam are increasing.
- If the number of incidents increase, it will harm the overall reputation of Ethereum blockchain ecosystem as a whole.

### How do you solve the problem?

- Provide cyber insurance policy for crowdsale investors and/or crowdsale companies that lost their cryptocurrencies during the crowdsale period due to malicious hack caused by bugs in the smart contract.
- Premium is calculated based on manual/automatic assessment of the risks of each crowdsale smart contract.

### Out of scope

- The rationality of the crowdsale project
- Whether the crowdsale terms are ethical or not.

## Research topics

### How do you major the risk of crowdsale?

Majoring security risks can be done by the followings.

- a. Verify that the known crowdsale has gone through recommended software release management procedures (either manually or by utilising source code repository API such as Github).
- b. Categorise complexity and risk of the smart contract (assessed by security auditor)
- c. Run automated analytics against smart contract to analyse risk level.
- d. Go through security bounty program.
